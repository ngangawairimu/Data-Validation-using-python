Module: Data Ingestion 

This module handles the ingestion of data into the Maji Ndogo farm survey database 

Import Statements: The code imports necessary modules such as create_engine and text from SQLAlchemy, logging, and pandas for data manipulation.

Logger Configuration: It configures a logger named 'data_ingestion' using the Python logging module. 
The logger will output log messages of level INFO and above to the console with a specific format including a timestamp, logger name, and log le
